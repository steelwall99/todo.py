Implementation plan.

The task is to create an improved task tracking application in python.
My requirements will be formatted in a list of now particular priority, but are,
the app needs to be able to list items, edit items, mark items are complete, And
delete items from the to do list.
I will own the code, and will update periodically via github.
Changes will be applied via github commits.
